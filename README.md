# trying_meltdown

This project is an attempt to understand how the project meltdown and the ringbuffer work. So I can use them in future projects.

This project sends fake contacts and then a consumer consumes them. The idea is to send more contacts that the consumer can process to understand how the ring buffer behaves in that case.

## Installation


## Usage

This is not a real project so the best option is to use lein

    $ lein run
